The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 72.63% and a ROC AUC score of 0.81, indicating a good balance between sensitivity and specificity.

Precision for defaulters (class 1): 0.83

Recall for defaulters: 0.56

F1-score: 0.67

Interpretation:

The model performs well in identifying non-defaulters (class 0) with high recall (0.89), but has room for improvement in capturing actual defaulters (recall = 0.56).

A ROC AUC of 0.81 reflects strong discriminatory power between defaulters and non-defaulters.

This model can be a useful screening tool in loan risk evaluation, helping financial institutions reduce credit risk exposure.
